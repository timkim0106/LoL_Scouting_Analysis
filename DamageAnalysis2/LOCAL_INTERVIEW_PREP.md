**LOCAL FILE - DO NOT COMMIT TO GITHUB**

## Project Summary

A Python-based analytics framework for League of Legends that calculates optimal champion builds through damage modeling and statistical analysis. The system implements complex game mechanics including item passives, ability scaling, and champion-specific interactions using Monte Carlo simulations.

### Key Technical Achievements
- **Game Mechanics Implementation**: Eclipse passive (6%/4% max HP every 2 hits), Muramana shock (mana-to-AD conversion), Smolder stacking system, Jayce ability enhancement
- **Statistical Analysis**: Monte Carlo simulations with 10,000 iterations, confidence interval calculations
- **Architecture**: Object-oriented design with Pydantic models, structured logging, environment-based configuration
- **API Integration**: Riot Games API client with rate limiting and retry logic
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib charts for build comparisons and armor penetration analysis

### Measurable Results
- Eclipse build: 2,360 damage vs Trinity build: 2,189 damage (7.8% improvement)
- Smolder 200 stacks: +61% damage increase
- Jayce enhanced Q: +37% damage increase
- Gold efficiency analysis: 0.268-0.323 damage per gold

## Interview Questions & Answers

### Technical Implementation Questions

**Q: Walk me through how you implemented the Eclipse passive mechanic.**
**A:** Eclipse deals percentage-based damage every 2 ability hits. I track ability hit counts in the damage calculation loop, increment an Eclipse proc counter every 2 hits, then apply 6% max HP damage for melee or 4% for ranged champions. The tricky part was ensuring the proc count persists across different abilities in a combo sequence.

**Q: How does your Monte Carlo simulation work for damage variance?**
**A:** The simulation runs 10,000 iterations where I apply random variance to target armor and magic resistance using numpy.random.normal with a 10% variance by default. Each iteration calculates damage with slightly different defensive stats, then I aggregate the results to get mean, standard deviation, and confidence intervals. This helps understand damage reliability across different scenarios.

**Q: What made you choose Pydantic for data validation?**
**A:** Pydantic provides runtime type checking and automatic validation, which is crucial when dealing with game data that can have edge cases. It also generates clear error messages when invalid data is passed, and the BaseModel integration makes it easy to serialize/deserialize champion and item data. The type hints also improve code maintainability.

**Q: How did you handle rate limiting for the Riot API?**
**A:** I implemented exponential backoff with retry logic. The client tracks request timestamps and enforces rate limits (100 requests per 2 minutes for personal keys). When hitting limits, it waits progressively longer between retries. I also added request queuing to batch API calls efficiently.

### Architecture & Design Questions

**Q: Why did you structure the project with separate models, analytics, and core modules?**
**A:** Separation of concerns - models handle data structure and validation, analytics contains pure calculation logic, and core orchestrates the business logic. This makes testing easier since I can unit test damage calculations independently of API calls, and it's more maintainable when game mechanics change.

**Q: How do you ensure your damage calculations are accurate?**
**A:** I cross-reference all values with the League of Legends wiki and game files. I also created a 3-tier testing system: basic mechanics tests, enhanced demonstrations, and full integration tests. For example, I verify that Muramana gives exactly 2% mana-to-AD conversion and that Eclipse procs occur at the right intervals.

**Q: How would you scale this to handle more champions?**
**A:** The abstract base classes make it straightforward to add new champions. Each champion inherits from BaseChampion and implements their specific mechanics. I'd create a champion factory pattern and move champion-specific data to JSON configuration files. The damage calculation engine is already generic enough to handle different ability types and scaling patterns.

### Problem-Solving Questions

**Q: What was the most challenging part of this project?**
**A:** Implementing the Smolder stacking system. Dragon Practice stacks affect different abilities with different scaling ratios (55% for Q/W, 12% for E), and the stacks can be passed as parameters or stored as champion state. I had to design a flexible system that could handle both scenarios while maintaining accurate damage calculations.

**Q: How do you handle edge cases in damage calculations?**
**A:** I validate inputs at multiple levels - Pydantic models catch invalid data types, the calculation functions check for negative values and clamp them to zero, and I have specific test cases for edge scenarios like 0 items, maximum stacks, and different target types. Error handling provides meaningful messages for debugging.

**Q: If you had to optimize this for performance, what would you do?**
**A:** First, I'd profile to identify bottlenecks, but likely candidates are the Monte Carlo simulations and repeated calculations. I'd implement caching for repeated damage calculations, vectorize operations using NumPy arrays instead of loops, and potentially move intensive calculations to Cython. For the API client, I'd add connection pooling and async operations.

### Business Impact Questions

**Q: How do you measure the success of your build recommendations?**
**A:** I use multiple metrics: raw damage output, gold efficiency (damage per gold spent), crossover points where builds become optimal, and statistical confidence intervals. For example, I can show that Eclipse builds are 7.8% more effective against low-armor targets but Trinity builds scale better against high-armor targets.

**Q: Who would use this kind of analysis?**
**A:** Primarily competitive players and coaches who need data-driven build decisions, content creators making guides, and game balance teams. The statistical rigor helps remove guesswork from itemization choices, especially for professional teams where small advantages matter.

**Q: How would you expand this into a product?**
**A:** Add a web interface for easier access, expand champion coverage, integrate with match history APIs for personalized recommendations, and add features like meta analysis across patches. I'd also implement user authentication and premium features like custom scenarios and advanced statistical reports.

### Technical Deep-Dive Questions

**Q: Explain your logging strategy.**
**A:** I use structured logging with rotating file handlers to prevent disk space issues. Logs include performance metrics, API call tracking, and error details with stack traces. The log level is configurable via environment variables, making it easy to adjust verbosity for development vs production. I also log key calculation steps for debugging complex damage scenarios.

**Q: How do you validate that your statistical confidence intervals are correct?**
**A:** I use z-score calculations (1.96 for 95% confidence) with the standard margin of error formula. I validate this by running known distributions through the system and comparing results to statistical software. The confidence intervals help quantify uncertainty in damage predictions, especially important for build recommendations.

**Q: What testing strategy did you implement?**
**A:** Three-tier approach: unit tests for individual mechanics, integration tests for full damage calculations, and end-to-end tests with real champion data. I test edge cases like zero items, maximum stacks, and different champion levels. Each special mechanic has dedicated tests to ensure accuracy against known values.
