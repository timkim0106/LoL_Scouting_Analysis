# Reworked the Damage Analysis

Python framework for League of Legends damage calculations and player analysis.


Champion damage analysis across different builds and scenarios
Professional player tracking and performance monitoring
Statistical analysis with Monte Carlo simulations and confidence intervals
Data visualization for build comparisons

Type safety with Pydantic data validation
Environment-based configuration
Structured logging with file rotation
Error handling and API rate limiting


- Build optimization across armor/MR ranges
- Gold efficiency analysis
- Damage calculations with special item mechanics (Eclipse, Muramana)
- Statistical confidence intervals
